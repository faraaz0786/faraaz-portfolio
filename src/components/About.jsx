          <p>
            I'm Mohd Faraaz Kalim, a passionate software developer with a solid background in computer
            science and emerging technologies. I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and
            Engineering with IBM (Data Science & Artificial Intelligence) and have gained both academic
            and professional experience in full-stack development/deployment, cloud computing and
            application software inspired by analytics. My final-year project, <em>Real-Time Monitoring
            and Data Management for Smart Meters Using IoT and Cloud Technologies</em>, is one such
            example in which I combine electronic hardware (sensors) and software (applications) to
            create flexible, customer-centric solutions.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3">
            My technical expertise includes Python, Java, Django, Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, and cloud
            platforms, with additional exposure to IoT hardware such as ESP8266 and energy monitoring
            sensors. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging AI, data science, and modern web
            technologies to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications.
            Beyond academics, I'm committed to continuous learning, problem-solving, and contributing to
            projects that drive efficiency, innovation, and meaningful user experiences.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-3">
            I strive to find opportunities focused on growth and flexibility, where I can engage my
            skills, collaborate with different teams, and pursue meaningful projects across software
            engineering, artificial intelligence, and cloud-based solutions.
